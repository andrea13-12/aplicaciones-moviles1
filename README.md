# ðŸ“± Desarrollo de Aplicaciones MÃ³viles

Welcome to my repository for the **Desarrollo de Aplicaciones MÃ³viles** class! This course focuses on building mobile applications using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, specifically in Java. Throughout the semester, we will cover key topics such as:

- **Java Programming Language**: Using Java instructions, methods, and visual controls to create applications.
- **Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementing classes, creating objects, and managing attributes and methods.
- **Collections**: Handling data groups with collections like `ArrayList` and using Java's `Collections` class.
- **OOP Characteristics**: Applying inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to develop robust and scalable software.

### ðŸ“š Learning Approach

The course employs various active learning strategies such as problem-based learning, project-based learning, and simulations. Classes can be attended in different modes: in-person, hybrid, remote, or fully virtual.

### ðŸ“Š Evaluation Criteria

- **Continuous Evaluation**: 40% (across different sessions)
- **Midterm Exam**: 30%
